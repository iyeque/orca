Based on my analysis of the codebase and the future features from update.md, here are the key findings:

Code Duplications and Redundancies:
The code for handling errors and and loading states is repeated across multiple React components (ShipmentForm, ShipmentList, DAOWidget, etc.)
API call patterns are duplicated in frontend components
Error Logic Inconsistencies:
Missing proper error handling for Web3/blockchain interactions
Missing Critical Features (from update.md):
Basic AI models without machine learning (Note: AI models have been enhanced, but still room for more sophisticated ML)
Limited visualization and dashboards
No notification system
Basic supplier analytics without advanced KPIs
No proper supplier suggestion engine frontend integration
No invoice anomaly detection
Limited PO workflow functionality
Architectural Issues:
Missing proper TypeScript types for frontend components
No proper state management solution for frontend (could use Redux/Context)
Security Concerns:
Sensitive data like private keys handled through environment variables without proper encryption (Note: Addressed by adding comments about secure management, but full encryption is out of scope for direct code changes.)
Recommendations for improvements:

Code Organization: (Partially addressed by moving data logic to DAO)
Frontend State Management:
