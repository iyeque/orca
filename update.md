# ORCA SCM Platform: Future Development Roadmap

This document outlines the recommended features and enhancements to further develop the ORCA SCM platform, based on the vision described in the `PURCHASE_ORDER_WORKFLOW_PO_KPIS_METRICS_.pdf` document.

## 1. Implement a Full Purchase Order Module

Create a dedicated module for managing the entire lifecycle of a Purchase Order (PO). This would involve:

- **PO Data Model:** A new data structure to represent a PO, including a unique ID, status (Pending, Approved, Rejected), line items, supplier information, and an audit trail.
- **Approval Workflow:** A configurable workflow to route POs for approval based on company policies (e.g., based on the total value of the PO).
- **Frontend Interface:** A new section in the dashboard to create, view, and manage POs.

## 2. Expand AI and Analytics Capabilities

Leverage the power of AI to provide deeper insights and automate more of the procurement process.

- **Supplier Suggestion Engine (Frontend Integration Pending):** Develop an AI model that recommends the best supplier for a given purchase based on historical performance data, cost, quality, and the other KPIs outlined in the document.
- **Advanced KPI Dashboards:** Go beyond the current analytics and implement the detailed **Cost-Saving**, **Quality**, and **Delivery** KPIs. This will provide a much richer and more actionable view of supplier performance.
- **Invoice Anomaly Detection:** Create a model to automatically detect discrepancies between invoices, purchase orders, and delivery notes, helping to prevent overbilling and other errors.

## 3. Build a Supplier Collaboration Portal

Create a secure, dedicated web interface for your suppliers to streamline communication and collaboration.

- **Supplier Login:** A system for suppliers to securely log in to the portal.
- **PO Management:** An interface for suppliers to view their purchase orders, acknowledge them, and provide updates.
- **Document Upload:** Allow suppliers to upload relevant documents, such as invoices or Advanced Shipping Notices (ASNs), directly to the platform.

## Additional Enhancements

Here are some additional recommendations for improving the robustness, accuracy, and user experience of the platform.

### 4. Enhance the AI Models

- **What:** The current AI models for delay and inventory prediction are based on simple rules. We could replace them with more sophisticated machine learning models.
- **Why:** A real machine learning model, trained on historical data, would provide much more accurate and reliable predictions. For example, the delay prediction could take into account factors like weather, carrier, and time of year.
- **Impact:** This would significantly increase the value and accuracy of the predictive features.

### 5. Add User-Facing Dashboards and Visualizations

- **What:** We could create more visual and interactive dashboards for analyzing the data.
- **Why:** Charts and graphs can often reveal insights more effectively than tables of data. For example, we could create:
    - A chart showing how inventory levels for a product have changed over time.
    - A map visualizing the routes of active shipments.
    - A bar chart comparing the performance of different suppliers.
- **Impact:** This would make the application more intuitive and powerful for end-users.

### 6. Implement a Notification System

- **What:** We could add a system to proactively notify users of important events.
- **Why:** Instead of requiring users to constantly check the dashboard, the system could automatically send an **email** or a **web notification** when:
    - Inventory for a product drops below the reorder threshold.
    - A new shipment is automatically created.
    - A shipment is predicted to be delayed.
- **Impact:** This would make the system more proactive and help users to stay on top of critical events.
